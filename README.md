# Random-forest-Regression-50_startUp

StartUp Company profit predict

first domain selction

1.machine learning 2.supervised learning 3.Regression

Load the .CSV file and Check the file

Using Mapping the phase of code

And import libray and assign the model creation

Then, Input and Output slipt

Then catogarical data convert the numerical data

And the additional inputs drop the cloumns and check this correct dataset in input data

And, Training and Test set Split

After model creation of import sklearn and using of evaluation of metrics

Regressor caluculte the hyper parameter in the project use to Criterion,Max_Features and Splitters calculate to use R2-score

Criterion-MSE,MAE and FRIEDMEN_MSE

Max_Features-BEST,RANDOM,SQRT,LOG2

Use to R2 Square formula and actual to predict value pass the formula and predict

0 to 1 using it near 1 is a good predict ex(0.90,0.99)

Then,check the model verify and save the model

Create a Decision Tree Regression liabray import the sklearn and fine calculate the mean and regressor called to a tranform using better calculation

And used to Graph library using it SKLEARN  using a tree of variable in regressor

Go to the deployment and create a new file and load the model and used to keywords of file

And predict the proft in single file data.

And open the file use the input and predict the user want to output to predict
